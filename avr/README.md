# Building and running the solution

To build the solution, first download [Atmel Studio](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/avr-support/atmel-studio-7). Then, open the .atsln file and build. This cannot be uploaded via the Arudino IDE; it must be done using a programmer (e.g. the [ATMEL-ICE](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATATMEL-ICE)).
